## Skin Installation

Before continuing, make sure you've completed all the steps in [Requirements Installation](#requirements-installation).

**Note:** Your skin might have a different installation process. Please check the README.md of the skin before continuing.  

1. Find a skin you want to use, see the skins supported by us above.

2. Download the latest release for that skin, see the release section on the right on the repo of that skin.

3. Extract the contents of `skin-name/dist` of your chosen skin **on top** of your [resource](#resource-folder-locations) folder.

4. Replace the files you're asked to replace. Next time you start Grande Omega it should appear in your chosen skin.

To change skin, restore the [resource](#resource-folder-locations) folder from the copy you made and repeat the installation steps.

You can restore Grande Omega's original files by extracting the contents of the [Template](https://github.com/Grande-Omega-Skins/template-skin/tree/master/dist) repo to your [resource](#resource-folder-locations) folder.

## Contributing

1. Create a new repo based on the [Skin Template Repo](https://github.com/Grande-Omega-Skins/template-skin). See the green **Use this template** button.

2. Setup signed commits. These make sure that the commits you make come from a trusted source.

3. Make sure your Skin uses the MIT license.

4. Create your own skin by modifying the files;

    - index.html
    - wwwroot/css/style.css
    - main.js

5. Modify the script at the bottom of index.html to use the code editor theme you want to use.

    Default Script:

    ```HTML
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/monaco-themes/dist/monaco-themes.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    	fetch("./wwwroot/themes/Eiffel.json")
    	.then((data) => data.json())
    	.then((data) => {
    		monaco.editor.defineTheme("theme", data);
    		monaco.editor.setTheme("theme");
    	});
    </script>
    ```

6. Remove all unused themes from `wwwroot/themes`.

7. Add a **README.md** file that;

    1. Links back to this repo for instructions.
    2. Include a description for your skin.
    3. Include screenshots of your skin.
    4. Include detailed installation instructions.

8. Change the skin.json file with he correct information, or the installer and/or update checker might fail (see the file structure below).

### **NOTE:** Any skins that modify the internal workings of Grande Omega will not be listed here.
